**SIMLR** and **CIMLR** Multi-kernel LeaRning methods 
===================================================== 

**OVERVIEW**

In this repository we provide implementations in both R and Matlab of *SIMLR* (https://www.nature.com/articles/nmeth.4207) and *CIMLR* (https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/02/16/267245). These methods were originally applied to single-cell and cancer genomic data, but they are in principle capable of effectively and efficiently learning similarities in all the contexts where diverse and heterogeneous statistical characteristics of the data make the problem harder for standard approaches. 

The main branch of the repository (named SIMLR) provides the code (both R and Matlab) for the two methods (namely *SIMLR* and *CIMLR*), but no data in order to make it smaller for download. Some example data together with the implementations are provided in the branch SIMLR_full (bigger to download). We recall that those data are provided purely as examples and should not be used in place of the ones provided in the respective publications. 

Moreover, the tools are also available on Bioconductor (https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/SIMLR.html). The branch master of this repository refers to the stable version on Bioconductor and the development branch of this repository refers to the development version on Bioconductor (https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/devel/bioc/html/SIMLR.html). 

The standard implementations of *SIMLR* are provided in the scripts *SIMLR.R* for R and *SIMLR.m* for Matlab. Similarly, we provide in the scripts *CIMLR.R* and *CIMLR.m* the implementations of *CIMLR* in both R and Matlab. 

Besides the standard implementation of *SIMLR*, we also provide *SIMLR_Large_Scale* to handle large scale datasets (scripts *SIMLR_Large_Scale.R* and *SIMLR_Large_Scale.m* for R and Matlab) and *SIMLR_Feature_Ranking* to rank the most important features for the learned similarities (scripts *SIMLR_Feature_Ranking.R* and *SIMLR_Feature_Ranking.m* for R and Matlab). We notice that this last function can also be used to prioritize features for the results by *CIMLR*, with the shrewdness of modifying the input data as follow: *CIMLR* takes as input a list of multiple data types (multi-omics) for the same samples (rows in the input matrices), which need to be trasformed into one unique input matrix with the same rows and by appending into it all the features (columns) of the list of matrices as input. As an example, if you provide to *CIMLR* 4 input data of 100 samples and 1000 features each, the input to compute the feature ranking will be one matrix of 100 rows and 4000 columns. 

Finally, we also provide scripts to estimate the number of clusters from the data as suggested in the original papers in the scripts *SIMLR_Estimate_Number_of_Clusters.R* and *SIMLR_Estimate_Number_of_Clusters.m* for *SIMLR* and *CIMLR_Estimate_Number_of_Clusters.R* and *CIMLR_Estimate_Number_of_Clusters.m* for *CIMLR*. 

**SIMLR**

Single-cell RNA-seq technologies enable high throughput gene expression measurement of individual cells, and allow the discovery of heterogeneity within cell populations.  Measurement of cell-to-cell gene expression similarity is critical for the identification, visualization and analysis of cell populations. However, single-cell data introduce challenges to conventional measures of gene expression similarity because of the high level of noise, outliers and dropouts. We develop a novel similarity-learning framework, *SIMLR* (Single-cell Interpretation via Multi-kernel LeaRning), which learns an appropriate distance metric from the data for dimension reduction, clustering and visualization. *SIMLR* is capable of separating known subpopulations more accurately in single-cell data sets than do existing dimension reduction methods. Additionally, *SIMLR* demonstrates high sensitivity and accuracy on high-throughput peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) data sets generated by the GemCode single-cell technology from 10x Genomics. 

*SIMLR* offers three main unique advantages over previous methods: (1) it learns a distance metric that best fits the structure of the data via combining multiple kernels. This is important because the diverse statistical characteristics due to large noise and dropout effect of single-cell data produced today do not easily fit specific statistical assumptions made by standard dimension reduction algorithms. The adoption of multiple kernel representations provides a better fit to the true underlying statistical distribution of the specific input scRNA-seq data set; (2) *SIMLR* addresses the challenge of high levels of dropout events that can significantly weaken cell-to-cell similarities even under an appropriate distance metric, by employing graph diffusion, which improves weak similarity measures that are likely to result from noise or dropout events; (3) in contrast to some previous analyses that pre-select gene subsets of known function, *SIMLR* is unsupervised, thus allowing de novo discovery from the data. We empirically demonstrate that *SIMLR* produces more reliable clusters than commonly used linear methods, such as principal component analysis (PCA), and nonlinear methods, such as t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE), and we use *SIMLR* to provide 2-D and 3-D visualizations that assist with the interpretation of single-cell data derived from several diverse technologies and biological samples. 

Furthermore, here we also provide an implementation of *SIMLR* (see SIMLR large scale) capable of handling large scale datasets. 

**CIMLR**

Outcomes for cancer patients vary greatly even within the same tumor type, and characterization of molecular subtypes of cancer holds important promise for improving prognosis and personalized treatment. This promise has motivated recent efforts to produce large amounts of multidimensional genomic ("multi-omic") data, but current algorithms still face challenges in the integrated analysis of such data. Here we present Cancer Integration via Multikernel Learning (*CIMLR*), a new cancer subtyping method that integrates multi-omic data to reveal molecular subtypes of cancer. *CIMLR* extends the original implementation of *SIMLR* to take as input multiple data matrices corresponding to different types of measurements upon the same set of tumors. We applied *CIMLR* to multi-omic data from 32 cancer types and showed significant improvements in both computational efficiency and ability to extract biologically meaningful cancer subtypes. The discovered subtypes exhibited significant differences in patient survival for 21 of the 32 studied cancer types. Our analysis revealed integrated patterns of gene expression, methylation, point mutations and copy number changes in multiple cancers and highlights patterns specifically associated with poor patient outcomes.

**RUNNING THE R IMPLEMENTATION**

We provide the R demo code to run our *SIMLR* on 4 examples in the script *R_main_demo_SIMLR.R*. Furthermore, we provide a large scale implementation of *SIMLR* (see large scale implementation) with 1 example in the script *R_main_demo_SIMLR_Large_Scale.R*. A demo for the estimation of the number of clusters by *SIMLR* is also provided in the script *R_main_demo_SIMLR_Estimate_Number_of_Clusters.R*. 

The R libraries required to run the demos can be installed by running the script *install_R_libraries.R*. We now present a set of requirements to run the examples. 

1) Required R libraries. *SIMLR* requires 2 R packages to run, namely the *Matrix* package (see https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/Matrix/index.html) to handle sparse matrices and the *parallel* package (see https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/parallel/doc/parallel.pdf) for a parallel implementation of the kernel estimation. 

To run the large scale analysis, it is necessary to install 4 more packages, namely *Rcpp* package (see https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/Rcpp/index.html), *pracma* package (see https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/pracma/index.html), *RcppAnnoy* package (see https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/RcppAnnoy/index.html) and *RSpectra* package (see https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/RSpectra/index.html). 

Furthermore, to run the examples, we require the *igraph* package (see http://igraph.org/r/) to compute the normalized mutual informetion metric and the *grDevices* package (see https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/grDevices/html/00Index.html) to color the plots. 

All these packages, can be installed with the R built-in *install.packages* function. 

2) External C code. We make use of an external C program during the computations. The code is located in the R directory in the file *projsplx_R.c*. In order to compite the program, one needs to run on the shell the command *R CMD SHLIB -c projsplx_R.c*. 

An OS X pre-compiled file is also provided. Note: if there are issues in compiling the .c file, try to remove the pre-compiled files (i.e., *projsplx_R.o* and *projsplx_R.so*). 

3) Example datasets. The 5 example datasets are provided in the directory data of the branch SIMLR_full. 

Specifically, the dataset of Test_1_mECS.RData refers to http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25599176, Test_2_Kolod.RData refers to http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4595712/, Test_3_Pollen.RData refers to http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25086649 and Test_4_Usoskin.RData refers to http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25420068. 

Moreover, for the large scale example, the dataset of Zelsel.RData refers to https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25700174. 

**RUNNING THE MATLAB IMPLEMENTATION**

We also provide the MATLAB code to run *SIMLR* on the 5 examples in the script *Matlab_main_demo_SIMLR.m* and *Matlab_main_demo_SIMLR_Large_Scale.m*. Furthermore, we provide two demos for *CIMLR* with the data from https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26061751.
