data(BuettnerFlorian)
}
\value{
list of 6: 
	in_X = input dataset as an (m x n) gene expression measurements of individual cells, 
 	n_clust = number of clusters (number of distinct true labels), 
 	true_labs = ground true of cluster assignments for each of the n_clust clusters, 
 	seed = seed used to compute the results for the example, 
 	results = result by SIMLR for the inputs defined as described, 
 	nmi = normalized mutual information as a measure of the inferred clusters compared to the true labels
